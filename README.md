A simple Unity Project using HandTracking via Deep Learning trained through Yolo v3.
A Webcam is required.
In the Game Scene, There is WebcamTexture in the middle of Scene and Show your hand.
Fist, Poining, Finger Victory gestures were trained and each gesture will fire different bullet.
Since images for training of Dataset are not so much enough, the hand would be recognized well with white and bright background.
